## IoT based smart library system

### Abstract: 

#### RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification): 
 RFID uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to 
objects. The tags contain electronically-stored information. Passive tags collect energy from 
a nearby RFID reader’s interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source 
(such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a 
barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded I 
he tracked object.

#### Node MCU:
Node Mcu is an open source IOT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the 
ESP8266 WI-FI SOC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 
module. The term “Node Mcu” by default refers to the firmware rather than the 
development kits.

#### Arduino IDE:
The Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) is a cross- platform application that 
is written in the programming language Java. T is used to write and upload programs to the 
Arduino board. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using the special rules of 
code structuring .

#### Passive tags: These look like small tags/ID cards which contains the electronic 
information( like a chip). One can see the chip if a torch is on the back side of the tag. 
The passive tag contains the electronically stored information comes near to the RFID 
sensor, the radio waves from the sensor detects that passive tag and sends the information 
to the MCU through Arduino IDE and MCU uses the WI-FI and we shall give the sender and 
the receiver’s email-id in base 64 format. And then we can send whatever information we 
want to send
